📫 How to reach me moore.2go.apps@gmail.com...
⚡ Real fact:I am a 40+ year old and after 8 surgeries and being diagnosed with T.M. I have been self learning coding and app development.
Now that I can no longer work a manual labor job, like I have since I was 16, "production worker", Heavy Equipment Operator, Truck Driver,
not so physical but dangerous considering I cant always feel or operate my legs🦵😯
So I found myself bored and found this AOSP and fell in love with tech.
😂Fun Fact. I got started in Android development when I was "wrongfully" trying to spy on my wife by wanting to see her deleted msgs, and pic's, etc
I seen an app that would claim to retrieve all that stuff for me. So I being a Tightwad as my wife says "Your so tight you squeak when you walk"😂
when I could that is😭 Long story short,It was then I realized that if the "app" could do this, I just needed to learn what the app was doing.
I thought "its not adding any hardware,so its just using the ohones built-in ability.Rather than spending a whopping $.99 USD 🤑aka "TightWad"--, I’m @Moore2GoAppLrnN
